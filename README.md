# MITqute ðŸš€

> Let's get entangled!

**MITqute** is where quantum computing flirts with matchmaking. Say goodbye to mundane swipes based on superficial likes; it's time for connections that resonate on a quantum level!

## What's the Big Idea?

Tired of the classic dating scene? Enter quantum computing. Love, like quantum mechanics, thrives on complexity and mystery. We're mixing the two to revolutionize how soulmates find each other.

## Quantum Love Potion

Brewing the potion involves:

- **Quantum Personalities:** Converting your answers into quantum bits, making your profile a quantum state that only the right person can collapse.
- **Matchmaking Algorithm:** With quantum algorithms, we reformulate the matchmaking problem with Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and let the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) work its magic to find your perfect match.

## Making It Fun ðŸŽ‰

- **Quantum Quirks:** Engage in a dating experience that's out of this world, with questions and choices inspired by the wonders of quantum physics.
- **Superposition of Choices:** Experience the thrill of uncertainty and excitement, quantum style!
